python detect_duplicates_safe.py --version
```

### Functional Differences Maintained:

#### `detect_duplicates.py` (v0.3)
- **Purpose**: High-performance batch processing  
- **Approach**: Single-pass normalized hash comparison
- **Best for**: Quick analysis of large collections
- **Database**: `photo_hashes.db`

#### `detect_duplicates_safe.py` (v0.3)  
- **Purpose**: Conservative safety-first processing
- **Approach**: Multi-phase with manual approval
- **Best for**: Production duplicate removal with safety
- **Database**: `multi_folder_duplicates.db`

### Next Steps:
Both scripts are now version-synchronized and ready for production use. The safe version provides the most comprehensive approach for actual duplicate removal operations.
